1. Go to flutter\bin\cache and remove a file named: flutter_tools.stamp

2- Go to flutter\packages\flutter_tools\lib\src\web and open the file chrome.dart.
(For Linux me the file was at ~/snap/flutter/common/flutter/packages/flutter_tools/lib/src/web/chrome.dart)

3- Find '--disable-extensions'

4- Add '--disable-web-security'
